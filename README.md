# cloudy-with-a-chance-of-weatherapi
Special thanks to Ruxin Qu. Would not get this far without her.

Description 
The objective of this project is to use the openweather api data to allow the users to see current and future weather of a city based on the user input. 

Mine is not complete but and I am only turning it in incomplete for the chance to redo it. 

Things that still need to get done: 
1. previous search history display on screen 
2. UV index display
3. formatting 
4. style
5. icons
6. Dates

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
